Netflix’s recommendation system helps them increase their popularity among service providers as they help increase number of items sold, offer a diverse selection of items, increase user satisfaction, as well as user loyalty to the company, and they are very helpful in getting a better understanding of what the user wants. Then it’s easier to get the user to make better decisions from a wide variety of movie products.

The idea behind the Netflix recommendation system is to recommend the most popular movies to users. They could be the most-watched, or also the ones with the highest ratings. The popularity of recommendations can be built based on usage data and article content.
